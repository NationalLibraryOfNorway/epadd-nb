#Help menu for Email-sources.jsp
email-sources.help.import-info= <br><br>Add the name of archive owner and an associated email address; ePADD won't work correctly without this information.\
<br>Import mail via an IMAP connection or an .mbox file.\
<br>Add the name of the email source when importing .mbox files to assist others in identifying the origin of associated messages.  This field is flexible and could include values like work, personal, office, laptop, etc. For email transferred via IMAP, the name of email source is assigned automatically as the email address associated with the archive owner.\
<br>You can further refine your import on the next screen by specifying particular mail folders, as well as a range of dates.\
<br>If you have email in non-mbox formats such as PST and Eudora, you can use programs like Emailchemy, Mailstore Home or Aid4Mail to convert them to mbox files.
