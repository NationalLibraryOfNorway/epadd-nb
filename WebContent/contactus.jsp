<h1>Takedown protocol for sensitive information found in email collections</h1>
      <p>
          Contributing institutions undertake steps to the best of their abilities to identify and remediate sensitive
          information that could threaten the privacy and security of individuals, organizations, or other entities
          represented in the collection(s).

          Despite these efforts, sensitive and/or private information inadvertently may be included in digital
          collections. In such cases, living individuals whose private information is exposed (or who are acting on
          behalf of a minor child or an incapacitated parent, spouse, domestic partner or adult child) may submit
          takedown requests. All such requests will be reviewed by the contributing institution. Persons requesting a
          takedown may be requested to supply additional information to better understand issues and their consequences.

          Given our commitment to preserving to the best of our abilities the authenticity and integrity of the
          scholarly and historical record in our archives, it is unlikely that perceived errors or inaccuracies present
          in original items will be “corrected”. Similarly, the contributing institutions will not remove access to
          materials other than in cases where there are legal concerns, for example, the presence of protected
          information arising from provisions of various laws, e.g. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
          (HIPAA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in or Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), or
          in cases of significant risks to privacy (for example, exposed Social Security numbers), or convincing
          evidence of a clear and imminent threat to personal safety and well-being.

      </p>
