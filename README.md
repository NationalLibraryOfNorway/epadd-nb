**ePADD (Email: Process Appraise, Discover, Deliver)** 

https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd

**Introduction**

ePADD is a software package developed by Stanford University's Special Collections & University Archives that supports archival processes around the appraisal, ingest, processing, discovery, and delivery of email archives.

The software is comprised of four modules:

Appraisal: Allows donors, dealers, and curators to easily gather and review email archives prior to transferring those files to an archival repository.

Processing: Provides archivists with the means to arrange and describe email archives.

Discovery: Provides the tools for repositories to remotely share a redacted view of their email archives with users through a web server discovery environment. (Note that this module is downloaded separately).

Delivery: Enables archival repositories to provide moderated full-text access to unrestricted email archives within a reading room environment.

**System Requirements**

OS: Windows 7 SP1 / 10, Mac OS X  10.10 / 10.11
Memory:  8 GB RAM (4 GB RAM allocated to the application by default)
Browser:  Chrome 60 or later, Firefox 55 or later
Windows installations: Java Runtime Environment 8u101 or later required. 

**Installation** 

(Note that a full installation and user guide is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1joUmI8yZEOnFzuWaVN1A5gAEA8UawC-UnKycdcuG5Xc).

ePADD has been tested on and optimized for Windows 7 SP1 / 10 and  Mac OS X  10.12 / 10.13, and Ubuntu 16.04. Please follow the instructions below for your operating system.

*Installing ePADD on Windows*

Please download the latest ePADD distribution files (.exe) from https://github.com/ePADD/epadd/releases/. You will need to have Java 1.8 or later installed on your machine for ePADD to work properly.

When you run ePADD for the first time, a directory for the Appraisal Module is created to store working files. When ePADD starts up, it checks this directory and relies upon it to resume earlier work.  If the software does not locate this directory, ePADD will create it. The ePADD Appraisal Module directory is located at c:\users\<username>\epadd-appraisal. 

In order for functionality for authority reconciliation to perform correctly, you must also separately download the configuration files (epadd-settings.zip), accessible via https://github.com/ePADD/epadd/releases/. Once downloaded, unzip this file into your user directory (c:\users\<username>\).

Depending upon your network permissions, you may be asked to allow ePADD access to your internet connection. Certain functionality (for instance, downloading email from an email account using the IMAP protocol, or communicating with DBPedia to generate relevance rankings for authority reconciliation) requires an internet connection. Upon running ePADD, the application icon  will appear in the Windows Taskbar. Right-click on this icon at any point to open an ePADD window or to quit ePADD.

Note: ePADD allocates 4096 MB RAM to the application by default. If the standard RAM allocated does not suffice, you may wish to run the Java application directly from the command line (epadd-standalone.jar). From the Command Prompt, you can run the application using this command: java -Xmx#g -jar epadd-standalone.jar, where # identifies the amount of RAM (in GB) you wish to allocate.

Note: The Discovery Module is run through a separate distribution file accessible via https://github.com/ePADD/epadd/releases/. Please see the installation and user guide for more information about the Discovery Module.

*Installing ePADD on OSX*

The ePADD Appraisal Module directory is located at Macintosh HD/Users/<username>/epadd-appraisal.
